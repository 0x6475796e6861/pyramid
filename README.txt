repoze.bfg
==========

``repoze.bfg`` is a system for routing web requests to applications
based on graph traversal.  It is inspired by Zope's publisher, and
uses Zope libraries to do much of its work.  However, it is less
ambitious and less featureful than any released version of Zope's
publisher.

Installation
------------

Install using setuptools, e.g. (within a virtualenv)::

  $ easy_install -i http://dist.repoze.org/lemonade/dev/simple repoze.bfg
