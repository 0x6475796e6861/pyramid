In order to add a feature to this package:

- The feature must be documented in both the API and narrative
  documentation (in docs/).

- The feature must work fully on the following CPython versions: 2.4,
  2.5, 2.6, and 2.7 on both UNIX and Windows.

- The feature must not cause installation or runtime failure on Jython
  or App Engine.  If it doesn't cause installation or runtime failure,
  but doesn't actually *work* on these platforms, that caveat should be
  spelled out in the documentation.

- The feature must not depend on any particular persistence layer
  (filesystem, SQL, etc).

- The feature must not add unnecessary dependencies (where
  "unnecessary" is of course subjective, but new dependencies should
  be discussed).

The above requirements are relaxed for paster template dependencies.
If a paster template has a dependency on something that doesn't work
on a particular platform, that caveat should be spelled out clearly in
*its* documentation (within docs/).
