Next release
============

Bug Fixes
---------

- Forward port from 1.3 branch: When no authentication policy was configured,
  a call to ``pyramid.security.effective_principals`` would unconditionally
  return the empty list.  This was incorrect, it should have unconditionally
  returned ``[Everyone]``, and now does.

Features
--------

- Custom objects can be made easily JSON-serializable in Pyramid by defining
  a ``__json__`` method on the object's class. This method should return
  values natively serializable by ``json.dumps`` (such as ints, lists,
  dictionaries, strings, and so forth).
