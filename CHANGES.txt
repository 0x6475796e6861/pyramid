Backward Incompatibilities
--------------------------

 - Following the Pyramid deprecation period (1.6 -> 1.8),
   daemon support for pserve has been removed. This includes removing the
   daemon commands (start, stop, restart, status) as well as the following
   arguments:
   --daemon --pid-file --log-file --monitor-restart --status --user --group
   --stop-daemon

   To run your server as a daemon you should use a process manager instead of
   pserve.

Features

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed bug in `proutes` such that it now shows the correct view when a class
  and `attr` is involved.
  See: https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2687

- Fix a ``FutureWarning`` in Python 3.5 when using ``re.split`` on the
  ``format`` setting to the ``proutes`` script.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2714

- Fix a ``RuntimeWarning`` emitted by WebOb when using arbitrary objects
  as the ``userid`` in the ``AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy``. This is now caught
  by the policy and the object is serialized as a base64 string to avoid
  the cryptic warning. Since the userid will be read back as a string on
  subsequent requests a more useful warning is emitted encouraging you to
  use a primitive type instead.
