Next release
============

Features
--------

- Python 3.2 compatibility (except for Paste scaffolding and paster commands,
  which do not work, because Paste has not been ported to Python 3 yet).

- Lone instance methods can now be treated as view callables (see
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/283).

Bug Fixes
---------

- Make test suite pass on 32-bit systems; closes #286.  closes #306.
  See also https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/286

- The ``pryamid.view.view_config`` decorator did not accept a ``match_params``
  predicate argument.  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/308

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- Pyramid no longer runs on Python 2.5 (which includes the most recent
  release of Jython, and the current version of GAE).

Dependencies
------------

- Pyramid no longer depends on the zope.component package, except as a
  testing dependency.

- Pyramid now depends on a zope.interface>=3.8.0, WebOb>=1.2dev,
  repoze.lru>=0.4, zope.deprecation>=3.5.0, translationstring>=0.4 (for
  Python 3 compatibility purposes).  It also, as a testing dependency,
  depends on WebTest>=1.3.1 for the same reason.
