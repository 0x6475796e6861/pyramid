Next release
============

Features (delta from BFG 1.3.X)
-------------------------------

- Mako templating renderer supports resource specification format for
  template lookups and within Mako templates. Absolute filenames must
  be used in Pyramid to avoid this lookup process.

- Add ``pyramid.httpexceptions`` module, which is a facade for the
  ``webob.exc`` module.

- Direct built-in support for the Mako templating language.

- A "squiggly" (Pylons-style) route syntax is now supported by
  ``pyramid.configuration.Configurator.add_route`` (and thus, by the
  ``route`` ZCML directive too).  For example, the following route
  patterns are equivalent: ``{foo}/{bar}`` and ``:foo/:bar``.  This is
  purely a syntactic affordance to make route patterns more tolerable
  for people coming from Pylons.

- A new configurator method exists: ``add_handler``.  This method adds
  a Pylons-style "view handler" (such a thing used to be called a
  "controller" in Pylons 1.0).

- New argument to configurator: ``session_factory``.

- New method on configurator: ``set_session_factory``

- Using ``request.session`` now returns a (dictionary-like) session
  object if a session factory has been configured.

Documentation (delta from BFG 1.3)
-----------------------------------

- Added a ``pyramid.httpexceptions`` API documentation chapter.

Backwards Incompatibilities (with BFG 1.3.X)
--------------------------------------------

- There is no longer an ``IDebugLogger`` registered as a named utility
  with the name ``repoze.bfg.debug``.

- The logger which used to have the name of ``repoze.bfg.debug`` now
  has the name ``pyramid.debug``.

- The deprecated API ``pyramid.testing.registerViewPermission``
  has been removed.

- The deprecated API named ``pyramid.testing.registerRoutesMapper`` 
  has been removed.

- The deprecated API named ``pyramid.request.get_request`` was removed.

- The deprecated API named ``pyramid.security.Unauthorized`` was
  removed.

- The deprecated API named ``pyramid.view.view_execution_permitted``
  was removed.

- The deprecated API named ``pyramid.view.NotFound`` was removed.

- The literal pattern ``{<anything>}`` is no longer permitted in route
  patterns (due to the addition of squiggly route pattern syntax
  support).
