0.2.3

  - Add API functions for authenticated_userid and effective_principals.

0.2.2

  - Add authenticated_userid and effective_principals API to security
    policy.

0.2.1

  - Add find_interface API.

0.2

  - Add wsgiapp decorator.

  - The concept of "view factories" was removed in favor of always
    calling a view, which is a callable that returns a response
    directly (as opposed to returning a view).  As a result, the
    ``factory`` attribute in the bfg:view ZCML statement has been
    renamed to ``view``.  Various interface names were changed also.

  - ``render_template`` and ``render_transform`` no longer return a
    Response object.  Instead, these return strings.  The old behavior
    can be obtained by using ``render_template_to_response`` and
    ``render_transform_to_response``.

  - Added 'repoze.bfg.push:pushpage' decorator, which creates BFG views
    from callables which take (context, request) and return a mapping of
    top-level names.

  - Added ACL-based security.

  - Support for XSLT templates via a render_transform method

0.1

  - Initial release.
