Next release
============

Features
--------

- Python 3.2 compatibility.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Make test suite pass on 32-bit systems; closes #286.  closes #306.
  See also https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/286

- The ``pryamid.view.view_config`` decorator did not accept a ``match_params``
  predicate argument.  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/308

- The AuthTktCookieHelper could potentially generate Unicode headers
  inappropriately when the ``tokens`` argument to remember was used.  See 
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/314.

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- Pyramid no longer runs on Python 2.5 (which includes the most recent
  release of Jython, and the current version of GAE as of this writing).

- The ``paster`` command is no longer the documented way to create projects,
  start the server, or run debugging commands.  To create projects from
  scaffolds, ``paster create`` is replaced by the ``pcreate`` console script.
  To serve up a project, ``paster serve`` is replaced by the ``pserve``
  console script.  New console scripts named ``pshell``, ``pviews``,
  ``proutes``, and ``ptweens`` do what their ``paster <commandname>``
  equivalents used to do.  Rationale: the Paste and PasteScript packages do
  not run under Python 3.

- The default WSGI server run as the result of ``pserve`` from newly rendered
  scaffolding is now the ``wsgiref`` WSGI server instead of the
  ``paste.httpserver`` server.  Rationale: Rationale: the Paste and
  PasteScript packages do not run under Python 3.

Dependencies
------------

- Pyramid no longer depends on the zope.component package, except as a
  testing dependency.

- Pyramid now depends on a zope.interface>=3.8.0, WebOb>=1.2dev,
  repoze.lru>=0.4, zope.deprecation>=3.5.0, translationstring>=0.4 (for
  Python 3 compatibility purposes).  It also, as a testing dependency,
  depends on WebTest>=1.3.1 for the same reason.

- Pyramid no longer depends on the Paste or PasteScript packages.
