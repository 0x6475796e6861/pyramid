Backward Incompatibilities
--------------------------

 - Following the Pyramid deprecation period (1.6 -> 1.8),
   daemon support for pserve has been removed. This includes removing the
   daemon commands (start, stop, restart, status) as well as the following
   arguments:
   --daemon --pid-file --log-file --monitor-restart --status --user --group
   --stop-daemon

   To run your server as a daemon you should use a process manager instead of
   pserve.

   See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2615

Features
--------

- The `_get_credentials` private method of `BasicAuthAuthenticationPolicy`
  has been extracted into standalone function ``extract_http_basic_credentials`
  in `pyramid.authentication` module, this function extracts HTTP Basic
  credentials from a ``request`` object, and returns them as a named tuple.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2662

- Pyramid 1.4 silently dropped a feature of the configurator that has been
  restored. It's again possible for action discriminators to conflict across
  different action orders.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2757

- ``pyramid.paster.bootstrap`` and its sibling ``pyramid.scripting.prepare``
  can now be used as context managers to automatically invoke the ``closer``
  and pop threadlocals off of the stack to prevent memory leaks.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2760

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed bug in `proutes` such that it now shows the correct view when a class
  and `attr` is involved.
  See: https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2687

- Fix a ``FutureWarning`` in Python 3.5 when using ``re.split`` on the
  ``format`` setting to the ``proutes`` script.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2714

- Fix a ``RuntimeWarning`` emitted by WebOb when using arbitrary objects
  as the ``userid`` in the ``AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy``. This is now caught
  by the policy and the object is serialized as a base64 string to avoid
  the cryptic warning. Since the userid will be read back as a string on
  subsequent requests a more useful warning is emitted encouraging you to
  use a primitive type instead.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2715

- Pyramid 1.6 introduced the ability for an action to invoke another action.
  There was a bug in the way that ``config.add_view`` would interact with
  custom view derivers introduced in Pyramid 1.7 because the view's
  discriminator cannot be computed until view derivers and view predicates
  have been created in earlier orders. Invoking an action from another action
  would trigger an unrolling of the pipeline and would compute discriminators
  before they were ready. The new behavior respects the ``order`` of the action
  and ensures the discriminators are not computed until dependent actions
  from previous orders have executed.

Deprecations

Documentation Changes
---------------------
- Updated Windows installation instructions and related bits.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/2661
