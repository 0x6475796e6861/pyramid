Major Features
--------------

- The file format used by all ``p*`` command line scripts such as ``pserve``
  and ``pshell``, as well as the ``pyramid.paster.bootstrap`` function
  is now replaceable thanks to a new dependency on
  `plaster <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/plaster/en/latest/>`_.

  For now, Pyramid is still shipping with integrated support for the
  PasteDeploy INI format by depending on the ``plaster_pastedeploy`` binding.

  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2985

- Added an execution policy hook to the request pipeline. An execution
  policy has the ability to control creation and execution of the request
  objects before they enter the rest of the pipeline. This means for a single
  request environ the policy may create more than one request object.

  The first library to use this feature is
  `pyramid_retry
  <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid-retry/en/latest/>`_.

  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2964

Features
--------

- Support an ``open_url`` config setting in the ``pserve`` section of the
  config file. This url is used to open a web browser when ``pserve --browser``
  is invoked. When this setting is unavailable the ``pserve`` script will
  attempt to guess the port the server is using from the
  ``server:<server_name>`` section of the config file but there is no
  requirement that the server is being run in this format so it may fail.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2984

Bug Fixes
---------

- HTTPException's accepts a detail kwarg that may be used to pass additional
  details to the exception. You may now pass objects so long as they have a
  valid __str__ method. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2951

- Fix a reference cycle causing memory leaks in which the registry
  would keep a ``Configurator`` instance alive even after the configurator
  was discarded. Another fix was also added for the ``global_registries``
  object in which the registry was stored in a closure preventing it from
  being deallocated. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2967

- Fix a bug directly invoking ``pyramid.scripts.pserve.main`` with the
  ``--reload`` option in which ``sys.argv`` is always used in the subprocess
  instead of the supplied ``argv``.
