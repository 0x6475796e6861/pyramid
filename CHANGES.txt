Next release
============

Features
--------

- Python 3.2 compatibility.

- New ``pyramid.compat`` module and API documentation which provides Python
  2/3 straddling support for Pyramid add-ons and development environments.

- A ``mako.directories`` setting is no longer required to use Mako templates
  Rationale: Mako template renderers can be specified using an absolute asset
  spec.  An entire application can be written with such asset specs,
  requiring no ordered lookup path.

- ``bpython`` interpreter compatibility in ``pshell``.  See the "Command-Line
  Pyramid" narrative docs chapter for more information.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Make test suite pass on 32-bit systems; closes #286.  closes #306.
  See also https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/286

- The ``pryamid.view.view_config`` decorator did not accept a ``match_params``
  predicate argument.  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/308

- The AuthTktCookieHelper could potentially generate Unicode headers
  inappropriately when the ``tokens`` argument to remember was used.  See 
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/314.

- The AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy did not use a timing-attack-aware string
  comparator.  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/320 for more info.

- The DummySession in ``pyramid.testing`` now generates a new CSRF token if
  one doesn't yet exist.

- ``request.static_url`` now generates URL-quoted URLs when fed a ``path``
  argument which contains characters that are unsuitable for URLs.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/349 for more info.

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- Pyramid no longer runs on Python 2.5 (which includes the most recent
  release of Jython and the Python 2.5 version of GAE as of this writing).

- The ``paster`` command is no longer the documented way to create projects,
  start the server, or run debugging commands.  To create projects from
  scaffolds, ``paster create`` is replaced by the ``pcreate`` console script.
  To serve up a project, ``paster serve`` is replaced by the ``pserve``
  console script.  New console scripts named ``pshell``, ``pviews``,
  ``proutes``, and ``ptweens`` do what their ``paster <commandname>``
  equivalents used to do.  Rationale: the Paste and PasteScript packages do
  not run under Python 3.

- The default WSGI server run as the result of ``pserve`` from newly rendered
  scaffolding is now the ``wsgiref`` WSGI server instead of the
  ``paste.httpserver`` server.  Rationale: Rationale: the Paste and
  PasteScript packages do not run under Python 3.

- The ``pshell`` command (see "paster pshell") no longer accepts a
  ``--disable-ipython`` command-line argument.  Instead, it accepts a ``-p``
  or ``--python-shell`` argument, which can be any of the values ``python``,
  ``ipython`` or ``bpython``.

Dependencies
------------

- Pyramid no longer depends on the zope.component package, except as a
  testing dependency.

- Pyramid now depends on a zope.interface>=3.8.0, WebOb>=1.2dev,
  repoze.lru>=0.4, zope.deprecation>=3.5.0, translationstring>=0.4 (for
  Python 3 compatibility purposes).  It also, as a testing dependency,
  depends on WebTest>=1.3.1 for the same reason.

- Pyramid no longer depends on the Paste or PasteScript packages.


Scaffolds
---------

- Rendered scaffolds have now been changed to be more relocatable (fewer
  mentions of the package name within files in the package).

- The ``routesalchemy`` scaffold has been renamed ``alchemy``, replacing the
  older (traversal-based) ``alchemy`` scaffold (which has been retired).
