Next release
============

Features
--------

- Custom objects can be made easily JSON-serializable in Pyramid by defining
  a ``__json__`` method on the object's class. This method should return
  values natively serializable by ``json.dumps`` (such as ints, lists,
  dictionaries, strings, and so forth).
