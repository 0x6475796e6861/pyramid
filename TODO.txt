:mod:`repoze.bfg` TODOs
=======================

- Supply ``X-Vhm-Host`` support.

- Review tutorials.

- Basic WSGI documentation (pipeline / app / server).

- Decide on INotFoundView and IForbidden interface, which are obsolete now.

- Document exception view lookup machinery:

    - Lookup proceeds by request interface first and then by interface provided
      by exception. 

    - If lookup fails with more special request interface (read as request
      interface related to some route) it will fallback to lookup by IRequest.

    - Current order of interfaces used for exception view lookup leads to the
      following statement: view with more special request interface and more
      common context interfaces always matched first, event if we have view
      with IRequest, but more special context interfaces (see integration tests
      with hybridapp for route9).

- Exception view backwards compat / features:

  - Add an "exception" attr to the request before calling an exception
    view.

  - Register wrapper views within set_notfound_view and
    set_forbidden_view (and ZCML if it doesn't call those) so that
    "context" is either the "real" context or None.

- Use Venusian for decorator scanning (fix Venusian to have scan
  categories first).

- Allow a translator to be supplied for template rendering.

- Figure out a way to expose some of the functionality of
  ``Configurator._derive_view`` as an API.
