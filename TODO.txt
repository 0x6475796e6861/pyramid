- path module: use pkg_resources (if feasible, given ZCML)

- audit use of "functools.wraps" (pickling no longer required)

- Docs: add interface docs for IAuthenticationPolicy and
  IAuthorizationPolicy, so people who care might be able to write
  their own.

- See if we can do something about always looking up ISettings when we
  want to see if auto template reload is on (queryUility is a bit
  expensive for this task).

- Do we really need to adapt on the root to find an ITraverserFactory?
